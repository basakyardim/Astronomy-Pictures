## Introduction
This application shows the list of the last 30 days' Astronomy Pictures and was built using one of the [Nasa Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) based on *Clean Architecture-MVVM* structure.
The full documentation of the used API can be found in the [APOD API Github Repository](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).

### :grey_question: What is Clean Architecture & MVVM
- MVVM is a design pattern that is built up of a *Model* which represents the data, a *View* that is the UI, and a *ViewModel* that links the data and the UI of the application.
- Clean Architecture is a philosophy in software that separates the code into different modules and sections with specific responsibilities via the use of layers (Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Framework & Drivers).
